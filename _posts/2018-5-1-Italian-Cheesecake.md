![Simple Italian Cheesecake](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecodallaluna/back2bake/master/images/2018/IMG_20180501_1.jpg)

This is a simple cheesecake recipe that uses fresh ricotta cheese and mascarpone cheese in even parts. The result is a fresh and lighter taste compared to the classic American Cheesecake made with processed soft cheese. The original recipe is from my friend [@maddarenna](https://www.instagram.com/maddarenna/), I just added few little alterations to adapt to my taste.

This recipe can be easily modified to make more sophisticated cakes. Please check the final session of this post for tastier versions. Just be sure to buy in advance the different ingredients and calculate extra time for the making.

### Ingredients

*Base for cake mold:*
* 200g Digestive cookies
* 80g melted unsalted butter
* 2 tablespoons of Muscovado sugar  

**Tips:**
* Muscovado sugar has a strong molasses taste that fiercely blend with the cheese filling;
* Equivalent quantity of honey can be a substitute of the Muscovado sugar if you prefer a less indulgent taste. However, it will be harder to incorporate the honey directly to the crumbled cookies. I suggest to melt the honey with the hot butter before to incorporate the cookies to the mix.

*Cheese filling:*
* 250g fresh ricotta cheese
* 250g mascarpone cheese
* 90g caster sugar  
* 20g corn or potato starch
* 3 large eggs, beaten
* 50ml double cream
* 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, or the seeds of half vanilla pod

**Tips:**
* Caster sugar is refined white cane sugar. It is extremely soluble with a lovely sweet scent. I hardly found it outside UK. Regular granular sugar can be a substitute;
* whipping cream can be a substitute if double/heavy cream is not available;
* the seeds of the vanilla pod are always the best ingredient for the aromatization, however vanilla pods are very expensive. Liquid vanilla extract is a cheaper alternative. Avoid vanillin or other artificial chemicals. In case of limited budget is possible to use the zest of an organic lemon instead of vanilla.

*Special tools:*
* Electric mixer (or a whip)
* Round mold 22cm diameter with a opening ring
* Cooling grill
* Silicone spatula 
* Rolling pin
* Baking paper

### Instructions:

1. Take the cake mold from the fridge. The cookie crumble mixture should be well adherent to the internal surface of the cake mold
1. Pour gently the cheese mixture inside the mold. Try to avoid to mix air to the mixture, bubbles  would be a problem during the cooking process. The silicone spatula could be helpful
1. Even the surface of the cake with the spatula, try to remove/explode potential bubbles under the surface of the cheese mixture
1. Put in the fan oven for one hour 
1. Check the surface of the cake, it should not become dark. You can cover the cake mold with an aluminium sheet or put the cake on the lower tray track to avoid that
