*A delicious green and white companion to every afternoon tea*

During my exploration of the best tea places in London I found this simple yet delicious cake. The loaf is easy to make, and it can be served with a great variety of tea blends.

My version is a variation of [this recipe](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/lauren-mcelwain/matcha-breakfast-loaf_b_10470984.html) by the Huffington Post. I like this recipe because the use of bananas keeps the loaf extremely tender. I modified a little the proportion of the ingredients based to my personal experience in loaf making. The real secret of the recipe is the blending of cheese icing with ground white chocolate. The result is an uneven, granular texture that surprises by contrast with the silky consistency of the green tea loaf.

*Time:* 1h preparation + 50mins cooking + 2-3 hours of cooling

### Ingredients
*Dry mix:*
* 300g cake flour 
* one and half teaspoons of baking powder
* 200g caster sugar 
* 2 or 3 generous tablespoons of matcha
* a pinch of fine salt

**Tips:**
* Cake flour is a special flour that is grounded very fine, and it has a very low percentage of proteins. It is perfect for cakes that require a fine texture. If it is not available, a mix of 250g of all purpose flour and 50g of potato starch is an acceptable replacement;
* Caster sugar is refined white cane sugar. It is extremely soluble with a lovely sweet scent. I hardly found it outside UK. Regular granular sugar can be a substitute;
* Do not waste ceremonial quality matcha. Instead, buy some cheap cooking matcha. 

*Wet mix:*
* 200ml milk room temperature
* 1 mature banana
* 3 eggs, beaten
* 100g melted unsalted butter
* 50g seed oil (e.g. sunflower, rapeseed, or corn oil)

*Icing mix:*
* one bar of white chocolate (100g)
* 50g unsalted butter at room temperature
* 80g soft cheese
* 250g icing sugar

*Special tools:*
* Strainer
* Cheese grater
* Jar blender or immersion blender
* Electric mixer 
* Rectangular baking mold for fruitcake
* Cooling grill
* Silicone spatula 

### Instructions:
1. Preheat the fan oven at 180c 
1. Grease the mold or, better, cover internally with baking paper
1. Prepare the dry mix. Take the strainer and a roomy bowl
1. In the bowl sift flour, baking powder and matcha. Add sugar and salt. Mix together until they are completely blended 
1. Prepare the wet mix. Cut the banana in pieces and but it with the blender with the milk. Turn on the blender until the banana is completely mixed with the milk. Add eggs, butter and oil and mix with the blender for few seconds
1. Pour the wet mix into the bow with the dry mix. Stir together with a spatula. It is important to do not stir too much. Just let the two mixes to merge together. It is ok to see few small clots of dry mix in the batter
1. Pour the batter into the mold. Briefly even the surface with the spatula
1. Put the mold in the oven for 50 minutes 
1. Test the cake with a skewer. If you insert a long skewer into the centre of the cake, it should come out clean, with no streaks of batter
1. Put the mold out to cool down for few minutes. As soon as you can touch the mold without burning yourself, remove the cake from the mold and put the cake to cool down and dry on the cooling grill. If you used the baking paper you can keep it on the cake
1. While the cake cool down, prepare the icing. Take a cheese grater and grate the chocolate to small shreds
1. Take the strainer and sift the icing sugar
1. Put cheese and butter in a bowl. Whip them very well with the electric mixer
1. Add the icing sugar little by little while continuing to whip the mixer
1. Once the ingredients are perfectly mixed, add the white chocolate and incorporate it with a spatula. Set aside while the cake cool down
1. When the cake is perfectly cold put it again inside the mold. This is going to make easier to top it with the white chocolate icing
1. Spread a generous layer of icing on the top of the cake. Help yourself with the spatula. Be sure that the icing stick to the surface of the cake. The icing is very soft at this point, however it will dry over time
1. Put again the cake to cool down in a dry and fresh place. In a couple of hours the icing will be dry enough to remove the mold. Bon app√©tit! 
1. Keep the cake inside a plastic bag or an plastic container, it will last few days. You can keep it at room temperature or in a fridge if room temperature is too warm
